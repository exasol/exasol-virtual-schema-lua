## Guidelines 

* When reporting a vulnerability, please include as much information as possible, including the complete steps to reproducing the issue. 

* Avoid sending us executables.

* Feel free to include any script you wrote and used but avoid sending us scripts that download and run unknown binaries. 

* We will prioritise reports that show how the exploits work in realistic environments. 

* We prefer all communications to be in English.
